# Crypto-Vault-App
Android App implementing Cryptographic & Image Steganography algorithms and much more.

## Abstract
Hide secret/sensitive data inside images for secret transmission, without any distortion in the quality of image/audio and to Encrypt confidential information by using different cryptographic techniques and to decrypt it whenever needed.

We combined both Cryptography & Steganography in one app to create a more secure and safe environment for your Privacy and Security.

Also, we have connected our app to AWS RDS Database, for storing RSA Keys and Encrypted Data.

## App Description
•	Image steganography for hiding secret data inside pixel values of the image using LSB embedding method.
(Thanks to aagarwal1012 on GitHub for the development of this amazing Library for Image Steganography)

•	Cryptographic Algorithms like AES, RSA etc. for encryption/decryption of confidential information.\
•	Secure communication of the secret key used in Image Steganography using RSA public-private key encryption system.\
•	Technologies used: Java, Android Studio, AWS RDS MySQL.\
•	Connected the app’s backend with AWS RDS, for storing and retrieving the encrypted data and the public keys.

## Requirements for running the app
•	A capable device hardware or AVD hardware required to run the Image Steganography process.\
•	Good Internet Connection required to store and retrieve data from AWS RDS backend.\
•	Min Android SDK of Android 10 Q needed to run the Android app.
