# Crypto-Vault-App
Android App implementing Cryptographic & Image Steganography algorithms and much more.

# Abstract
Hide secret/sensitive data inside images for secret transmission, without any distortion in the quality of image/audio and to Encrypt confidential information by using different cryptographic techniques and to decrypt it whenever needed.\

We combined both Cryptography & Steganography in one app to create a more secure and safe environment for your Privacy and Security.\

Also, we have connected our app to AWS RDS Database, for storing RSA Keys and Encrypted Data.

# App Description
•	Image steganography for hiding secret data inside pixel values of the image using LSB embedding method.\
•	Cryptographic Algorithms like AES, RSA etc. for encryption/decryption of confidential information.\
•	Secure communication of the secret key used in Image Steganography using RSA public-private key encryption system.\
•	Technologies used: Java, Android Studio, AWS RDS MySQL.\
•	Connected the app’s backend with AWS RDS, for storing and retrieving the encrypted data and the public keys.

# Hardware & Software Requirements for running the app
•	A capable device hardware or AVD hardware required to run the Image Steganography process.\
•	Good Internet Connection required to store and retrieve data from AWS RDS backend.\
•	Min Android SDK of Android 10 Q needed to run the Android app.
